# Possible Challenges

## 1. Make an immersive 360 degree VR App

Adress a journalistic challenge (tell a story, explain an issue, present news, ...) using immersive 360 degree material within a VR App. 360 degree material might be hard to come by. Otherwise, you can always choose to produce your own material (e.g. by using the streetview app, or a 360 degree camera).

Questions:
* What should the purpose of the app be?
* What kind of 360 degree footage do we need? How can we get it?
* Do we "only" want to present the 360 degree footage using VR or do we want to embed it in a complete VR space?

## 2. Make a VR app using only "flat" material

How can VR benefit you in adressing a journalistic challenge (tell a story, explain an issue, present news, ...) by merely using "flat" (non 360 degree) material. The challenge here is not so much in getting the footage (flat footage is relatively easy to come by), but more in how to use the possibilities a VR space brings, such that it enables a new / more immersive / more interesting / more educating experience.

Questions:
* What should the purpose of the app be?
* What material do you want to present? What is the sotry?
* How can you use the VR space to put the material in connection? What user interactions do you need to provide?

## 3. A hybrid of the above / something completely different

Merge the two above, or try something completely different. It's up to you -- as long as it addresses a journalistic challenge.
