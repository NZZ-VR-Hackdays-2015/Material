# Video Resources

## General
* [archive.org](https://archive.org/) host more than just the waybackmachine: audio, video, pictures. Very well curated. Especially note thecollections, e.g. ["News & Public Affairs"](https://archive.org/details/newsandpublicaffairs&tab=collection)
* [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com) is of course a good source for videos.

## 360 degree video
*  There are many [360-degree videos on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzuqhhs6NWbgTzMuM09WKDQ). 360 degree videos are stored as "usual" videos but in a equirectangular projection.

## NZZ
* Check the videos on our website. If you find one that you'd like to use (or parts of it), please talk to Flavio -- he will make the video available for you. (Even parts of it!).
